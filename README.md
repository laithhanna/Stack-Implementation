# Stack implementation using Singly LinkedList
Hello,

This is my Implementation of a stack using Singly LinkedList. I have provided great comments in the source code. Basically, everything is well documented so you can find it easy
to understand and deepen your knowledge of stacks!

Notes:
```
1- Our Stack is implemented using Singly LinkedList
2- The implementation,comments and documentation of how the methods work are addressed in the source code
3- our stack will hold integer values
```

Methods supported by the Stack:
```
void push()
int pop()
int peek()
int size()
Boolean isEmpty()
void printStack()
```
